2. Email **iamajser@gmail.com** with:
   - A description of the vulnerability

You should receive a response within 72 hours. We will work with you to understand the issue and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

## Security Measures

MarkerOn is designed with security in mind:

- **No network access** — the app does not collect telemetry or send data anywhere
- **Local-only config** — all settings are stored locally in the system config directory
- **URL allowlist** — the `open_url` command only permits pre-approved domains
- **Memory-only drawings** — annotations exist only in RAM and are never written to disk
- **CSP enforced** — Content Security Policy restricts the webview to local resources only
