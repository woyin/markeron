- `assets/language-switcher.png`
- `assets/preserve-drawings-setting.png`

Prefer regenerating from the live app before promoting them again.

## Regenerating marketing PNGs

Source HTML lives in `assets/store-screenshots/scene*.html` (designed at 1920×1080). Export at 2880×1530 for README / website / Store listings.

Optional helper: `scripts/export-store-screenshots.mjs` (requires Playwright Chromium). Or open each HTML in Chrome at 1920×1080 and save a viewport screenshot, then scale to 2880×1530.

After changing tools / shortcuts / panel copy in those HTML files, re-export and overwrite the PNG paths above (and matching `docs/assets/*` copies).

## New Social Concept Visual

`assets/social/click-through-social-square.png` was generated as a supporting illustration, not a literal MarkerOn screenshot. Captions should label it as an illustration if the context could confuse it with the real interface. Pair it with the real click-through GIF in launch galleries.

Generation prompt:

> Create a premium square software-product illustration on a deep navy background: a modern dashboard window with a coral circle and arrow, yellow highlight, blue rectangle, and laser glow on an annotation layer; show a cursor clicking a button underneath while every annotation remains visible. No text, logo, brand imitation, people, watermark, or pseudo-text.

## Gallery Order

For Product Hunt, directories, and press kits:

1. Real click-through GIF or MP4.
2. Real desktop annotation screenshot.
3. Real shortcut reference.
4. Real settings / tools screenshot.
5. Concept visual as a supporting cover, not as proof of UI.

This order makes the distinctive behavior visible before feature lists.
