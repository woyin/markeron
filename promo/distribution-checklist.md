Metrics are a dated baseline, not evergreen marketing copy. Release asset downloads count files, not unique users.

## Ready Now

### GitHub Pages Website

- Status: live
- Local source: `docs/`
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Custom domain: `https://markeron.cn/`

### WinGet via Microsoft Store

MarkerOn already appears in the Microsoft Store WinGet source:

- Alternatives to list against: ZoomIt, Epic Pen, gInk, ppInk, ScreenBrush

Official FAQ says to use "Suggest new application" from the user menu and submit platforms, license, descriptions, tags, and related fields.

## Package Manager Expansion

### Scoop

Status: live in Scoop Extras.

- Manifest: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/blob/master/bucket/markeron.json
- Initial PR: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/18304
- Install: `scoop bucket add extras && scoop install markeron`

The upstream manifest has automatic GitHub version checks. Monitor its update PR after each release; do not open duplicate update PRs.

Local note: `packaging/scoop/README.md`

Target repository:

- Scoop Extras: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras

### Homebrew Cask

Draft cask exists at `packaging/homebrew/markeron.rb`.

Before submitting, test on macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask ./packaging/homebrew/markeron.rb
brew uninstall --cask markeron
```

Official references:

- Adding software: https://docs.brew.sh/Adding-Software-to-Homebrew
- Cask cookbook: https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook
- Acceptable casks: https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks

## Optional Directories

### SourceForge

Useful if you want an additional open-source project page and download mirror. SourceForge expects an open-source project, summary, icon, description, and screenshots.

Links:

- Create project: https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Create%20a%20New%20Project/
- Promote project: https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Promoting%20your%20project/

### Softpedia

Potentially useful for discovery, but submit carefully and make the GitHub/Microsoft Store official channel clear. Prioritize directories that link to the official downloads without repackaging.

## Existing Coverage — Do Not Duplicate

- V2EX: https://www.v2ex.com/t/1204012
- V2EX follow-up discovered in search: https://www.v2ex.com/t/1222261
- Reddit r/tauri: https://www.reddit.com/r/tauri/comments/1sjh08d/markeron_a_lightweight_screen_annotation_tool/
- Reddit r/vuejs: https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/1slvt7f/markeron_a_lightweight_screen_annotation_tool/

- Organic article: https://myqqjd.com/84790.html

Only post again in an existing community for a substantial feature story, tutorial, or milestone. Do not repost minor patch releases.

## 30-Day Launch Order

### Week 1 — Conversion foundation

1. Deploy the corrected website metadata and evergreen copy.
2. Verify the public release and all official downloads.
3. Capture one 10–15 second click-through demo and one whiteboard demo.
4. Submit AlternativeTo and Product Hunt with the website as the canonical link.
5. Submit Show HN with the GitHub repository as the URL and a technical maker comment.

### Week 2 — Chinese creator channels

1. Publish one Bilibili demo video and reuse the vertical cut for 视频号 / 抖音 / 小红书.
2. Published a transparent “作者自荐” Zhihu answer comparing MarkerOn with ZoomIt and gInk: https://www.zhihu.com/question/384946892/answer/2063224352896766963
3. Publish the Tauri implementation article on 掘金; optionally cross-post to CSDN / OSCHINA with a canonical link back to the website or GitHub.
4. Pitch 少数派 only after the demo video and current screenshots are ready.

### Week 3 — Open-source distribution

1. Confirm the Scoop manifest auto-updates after the latest release.
2. Test the Homebrew cask on both Apple Silicon and Intel if possible, then submit.
3. Submit to relevant curated awesome lists only where MarkerOn clearly matches the list scope.
4. Post to r/opensource with an open-source / architecture angle; do not reuse the r/tauri copy.

### Week 4 — Earned media and compounding SEO

1. Send personalized pitches to 10 software newsletters / teaching-tech editors.
2. Publish “MarkerOn vs ZoomIt vs Epic Pen” and “How to annotate over any app” articles on `markeron.cn`.
3. Answer relevant Zhihu, Reddit, and Stack Exchange questions with disclosed affiliation and useful comparison content.
4. Review UTM traffic, stars, downloads, and retention; repeat the two channels with the strongest qualified traffic.

## Success Metrics

Track by channel at 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days:

- Qualified website sessions (UTM)
- GitHub stars and watchers
- Release asset downloads (remember: per-file, not users)
- Microsoft Store acquisitions if Partner Center is available
- Issue quality and first-time contributors
- Video completion rate and saves/shares
- Conversion from landing page to an official download

Avoid optimizing for raw impressions alone; channels that produce downloads, useful feedback, or repeat users matter more.
